<h1>face-mask-detection</h1>
<h3>Facemask detection program and pre-trained weights!</h3>
<p> This is my first project on the live object detection, so please feel free to suggest changes where necessary </p>

<b>The code was made for the Colab environment so when running offline make appropriate changes.</b>
<ul>
  <li>Project inspired from : <a href= https://github.com/aieml >perceptron </a> </li>
  <li>Dataset from :<a href =https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data> Prajna Bhandary</a></li>
 </ul>

<i>Note : The model uses a CNN architecture so errors due to outside noise may cause variation from expected output.</i>
